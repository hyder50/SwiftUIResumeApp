# ResumeAppWithSwiftUI
A Resume app for iPad created during the learning process of SwiftUI

# Inspiration:
The app is totally based off of [this](https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/downloads/Resume_RendonCepeda.pdf) Resume template, a bit altered though.

# Features of the app:
### Theming:
The theme of the resume is totally customisable. [Modify the values in <i>‘Configuration.swift’</i> file]

All the images used in the resume app are fonts and hence their colours are also configurable.



### Feed Content:
Modify the <i>‘sample_data.json’</i> file to display your resume

Completely written with SwiftUI which means the UI of the app should dynamically align based upon the contents fed to it.

Note: There are some [pending issues](https://github.com/saru2020/SwiftUIResumeApp/issues) for which I’m still trying to find a fix. 
PRs are very much welcome :)
